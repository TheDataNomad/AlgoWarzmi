    "    This data is from the OpenData platform of SAMA containing historical data Monetary Survey:\n",
    "    The data is split into 3 parts - Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly- Our target is to get the monthly data\n",
    "    It contains different data points such Currency Outside Banks, Demand Deposits, Quasi Money in details, Total Liabilities and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your end goal target is to extract the monthly data of Total Liabilities and build the best forecasting model\n",
